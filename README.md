## Repository Introduction

Self Directed Search is an assessment tool developed by John Holland, an American career guidance expert, based on his extensive experience in Career counseling and his theory of career type. Holland believes that there should be an inherent correspondence between personal career interests and professions. According to different interests, personality can be divided into six dimensions: research-oriented (I), artistic (A), social (S), entrepreneurial (E), traditional (C), and realistic (R). Each person's personality is a combination of these six dimensions to varying degrees. This warehouse utilizes pyecharts and pywebio to present all questions in sequence and allow users to answer them to determine the final type of user use.
